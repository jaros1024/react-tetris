# React Tetris

Classical Tetris game written in ReactJS with MobX and equipped with Webpack Dev Server.

## Requirements

In order to run it, you need `npm` in your environment.

## Installation

Execute `npm install` in the project root repository.

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Game is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run dev`

Same as `npm run build`, but this creates a development build, which means it is not optimized. You should use it to open it in a development environment, but using 3rd party server.
